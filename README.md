## 🚀 Introduction
In a world where 24/7 customer support is no longer a luxury but an expectation, businesses are increasingly turning to chatbots. However, many existing solutions fall short, offering rigid, rule-based interactions that frustrate users and fail to resolve complex issues.

Our project tackles this problem head-on by developing a "Universal Chatbot Assistant" that is:

🧠 **Intelligent**: Powered by Gemini to understand and respond to a wide range of queries with a human like persona.

🔌 **Plug-and-Play**: Designed with a framework-agnostic approach, allowing for seamless integration into existing systems with minimal development time.


## ✨ Key Features

✈️ **Multi-Role Capabilities**: In our travel industry demonstration, the chatbot can act as a:

- **Travel Planner**: Offers personalized trip suggestions and itineraries.
- **Offers Finder**: Searches for the best deals on flights, hotels, and airport transfers.
- **Customer Service Agent**: Handles FAQs, provides detailed policy information, and offers general support.

🎫 **Seamless Zendesk Integration**:

- **Ticket Creation**: Automatically creates support tickets for issues that require human intervention.

- **Live Agent Handover**: Smoothly transfers conversations to a human agent when necessary, providing them with the full context of the interaction.

🌐 **Universal API**: Our "plug-and-play" API is built on the principles of the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it easy for any business to integrate our chatbot's capabilities into their own systems.

## 🛠️ Frameworks and Technologies
This project is built on a foundation of cutting-edge frameworks and technologies to ensure a robust, scalable, and intelligent solution:

🤖 **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: An AI agentic framework that allows for the creation of multi-agent architectures with low code. It's model and framework-agnostic, supporting various LLMs.

🔄 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard that standardizes how AI applications interact with external data sources, allowing our chatbot to access real-time information from APIs.

🤝 **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**: An open standard that enables secure and seamless communication between different AI agents, allowing for complex, collaborative workflows.

✈️ **Amadeus Travel API**: Our primary data source for real-time flight, hotel, and transfer offer prices.

🔍 **Tavily Search**: An API that grounds our chatbot with web searches, giving it access to the latest information for trip recommendations and transportation services.

🧠 **Pinecone Vector Database**: A vector embedding database that enables powerful semantic searches for our FAQ and knowledge base features.

💬**Zendesk**: A leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software that we've integrated for web conversations, support ticketing and live agent handover.

💻 **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, PHP, and Bootstrap for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

⚙️ **Backend**: Powered by FastAPI and a MySQL database hosted on Azure.
